## What's this

A car selling manager. hust 2016 C programming course assignment.

notice: due to course timetable changes in the next year,

I hereby claim that this project is assigned at 2017 summer holiday.

the zhwkre included here is a modified version of my zhwkre repo.

removed some functions and added some functions to fully satisfy the

criteria specified in instruction book.

## Makedepend

- Linux/Unix environment -- for networking and concurrent.
- gcc 7.1.1(20170528) or 7.1.1-3
